The upstream Gnulib project doesn’t do releases but rather simply incorporates changes and bug fixes directly into the master branch. The programming examples in this chapter were written to use Gnulib source code from commit f876e0946c730fbd7848cf185fc0dcc712e13e69 in the Savannah Gnulib git repository. If you’re having trouble getting the code in this chapter to build correctly, it could be because something has changed in the Gnulib source since this book was written. Try backing off to this commit of Gnulib.
