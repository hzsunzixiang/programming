sources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h
foo: 
	@echo $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources))
#$(filter pattern…,text)
#	Returns all whitespace-separated words in text that do match any of the pattern words, removing any words that do not match. The patterns are written using ‘%’, just like the patterns used in the patsubst function above.
#
#	The filter function can be used to separate out different types of strings (such as file names) in a variable. For example:
#
#	sources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h
#	foo: $(sources)
#	        cc $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources)) -o foo
#			says that foo depends of foo.c, bar.c, baz.s and ugh.h but only foo.c, bar.c and baz.s should be specified in the command to the compiler.
