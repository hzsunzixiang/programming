If a user’s system is missing the pthread.h header file, for instance, they’d
see different output. To emulate this for testing purposes, we can use a trick
involving Autoconf cache variables. By presetting the cache variable that
represents the presence of the pthread.h header to no, we can trick configure
into not even looking for pthread.h because it assumes the search has already
been done if the cache variable is already set. Let’s try it out:

./configure ac_cv_header_pthread_h=no


— Macro: AC_CHECK_HEADERS (header-file..., [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found], [includes])
This macro caches its result in the ac_cv_header_header-file variable, with characters not suitable for a variable name mapped to underscores.
