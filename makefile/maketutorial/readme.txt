You can define your own implicit rules by writing pattern rules.

Suffix rules are a more limited way to define implicit rules. Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are retained for compatibility.

• Using Implicit:	  	How to use an existing implicit rule to get the recipes for updating a file.
• Pattern Rules:	  	How to define new implicit rules.
• Suffix Rules:	  	The old-fashioned style of implicit rule.
