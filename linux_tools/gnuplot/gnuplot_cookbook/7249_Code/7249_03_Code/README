Each file in this directory is named the same as one of the 
recipes in the chapter and contains the code example from the
"How to do it" section of the recipe, with some changes to
certain recipes, as described below. 

Each file can be run from the terminal with the command "gnuplot
--persist <file>", substituting the name of the file for
"<file>". The "--persist" option tells gnuplot to keep the graph
window open and is necessary for the scripts that do not create 
their plots in output files, so you can see the result. Each
 script has been tested with gnuplot 4.4.3 and produces a plot
similar to the illustration in the chapter. In the cases where
 the script has been changed from the version in the chapter, the
 changes consist only in adding a "set terminal" command and/or
changing the names of output files to have the extension 
appropriate to the terminal. It is impossible to know which
 terminals (gnuplot graphical output devices) the reader has 
installed; therefore the terminal command was omitted from some 
of the recipes in order to make them more general. However, as 
scripts that produce output files need to have a terminal 
defined, one had to be selected in order for the script to be 
runnable. If you do not happen to have the terminal installed, 
you will get an error; in this case you must edit the script to
 the selected one of the available terminals on your system. The scripts that are intended to produce a plot on the screen 
rather than in a file will open an x11, wxt, or Aquaterm window,
depending on your installation and your default.
