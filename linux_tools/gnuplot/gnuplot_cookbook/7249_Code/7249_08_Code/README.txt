The directory called "code" contains the code samples for the recipes in this 
chapter. Each code file is named after its recipe. You can load them into 
gnuplot at the interactive prompt with the "load" command or execute them on 
the system command line with "gnuplot --persist FILE"; substitute the name of
the code file for FILE. The "--persist" option will cause the graph to remain 
on the screen after gnuplot exits.
