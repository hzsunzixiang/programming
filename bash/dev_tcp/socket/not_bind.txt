https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/49936/dev-tcp-listen-instead-of-nc-listen

Unfortunately it's impossible to do with just bash. /dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> virtual files are implemented in the way that bash tries to connect to the specified <ip>:<port> using connect(2) function. In order to create listening socket, it would have to call bind(2) function.

You can check this by downloading bash sources and looking at it. It is implemented in lib/sh/netopen.c file in _netopen4 function (or _netopen6, which also supports IPv6). This function is used by wrapper function netopen from the same file, which in turns is directly used in file redir.c (redir_special_open function) to implement this virtual redirection.

You have to find some other application that can create listening socket on your machine.
