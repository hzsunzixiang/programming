DES
============

https://github.com/mimoo/DES.git

This is an implementation in C of DES (Data Encryption Standard).

This is to be used only for files that are multiples of 64 bits **exactly**. We used ECB as a [mode of operation][1] but haven't implemented any padding system (it is not the point, if you want to add it you can always fork the code!).

[DES][2] is a broken cypher and this work is intended for educational purpose.

Files
----

* **DES.c** and **DES.h** contain the functions used in the DES algorithm.

* **main.c** builds the algorithm and allows you to encrypt/decrypt an input file.

Use make to build desbox.

    $ make
    
    $ desbox --help

* **genkey.c** is a key generator that prevents weak keys. Use it if you don't have any key to use.

Use make to build the keygen.

    $ make genkey

    $ ./genkey
