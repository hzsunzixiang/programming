NAME
       ciphers - SSL cipher display and cipher list tool.

SYNOPSIS
       openssl ciphers [-v] [-V] [-ssl2] [-ssl3] [-tls1] [cipherlist]

DESCRIPTION
       The ciphers command converts textual OpenSSL cipher lists into ordered SSL cipher preference lists. It can be used as
       a test tool to determine the appropriate cipherlist.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose option. List ciphers with a complete description of protocol version (SSLv2 or SSLv3; the latter includes
           TLS), key exchange, authentication, encryption and mac algorithms used along with any key size restrictions and
           whether the algorithm is classed as an "export" cipher.  Note that without the -v option, ciphers may seem to
           appear twice in a cipher list; this is when similar ciphers are available for SSL v2 and for SSL v3/TLS v1.

       -V  Like -v, but include cipher suite codes in output (hex format).

       -ssl3, -tls1
           This lists ciphers compatible with any of SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2.

       -ssl2
           Only include SSLv2 ciphers.

       -h, -?
           Print a brief usage message.

       cipherlist
           A cipher list to convert to a cipher preference list. If it is not included then the default cipher list will be
           used. The format is described below.

CIPHER LIST FORMAT
       The cipher list consists of one or more cipher strings separated by colons.  Commas or spaces are also acceptable
       separators but colons are normally used.

       The actual cipher string can take several different forms.

       It can consist of a single cipher suite such as RC4-SHA.

       It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain algorithm, or cipher suites of a certain type. For
       example SHA1 represents all ciphers suites using the digest algorithm SHA1 and SSLv3 represents all SSL v3
       algorithms.

       Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single cipher string using the + character. This is used as a logical and
       operation. For example SHA1+DES represents all cipher suites containing the SHA1 and the DES algorithms.

       Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters !, - or +.

       If ! is used then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.  The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the
       list even if they are explicitly stated.

       If - is used then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or all of the ciphers can be added again by later
       options.

       If + is used then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list. This option doesn't add any new ciphers it just moves
       matching existing ones.

       If none of these characters is present then the string is just interpreted as a list of ciphers to be appended to the
       current preference list. If the list includes any ciphers already present they will be ignored: that is they will not
       moved to the end of the list.

       Additionally the cipher string @STRENGTH can be used at any point to sort the current cipher list in order of
       encryption algorithm key length.

CIPHER STRINGS
       The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their meanings.

       DEFAULT
           The default cipher list.  This is determined at compile time and is normally
           ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!aNULL:!eNULL:!SSLv2.  When used, this must be the first cipherstring specified.

       COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT
           the ciphers included in ALL, but not enabled by default. Currently this is ADH and AECDH. Note that this rule
           does not cover eNULL, which is not included by ALL (use COMPLEMENTOFALL if necessary).

       ALL all cipher suites except the eNULL ciphers which must be explicitly enabled; as of OpenSSL, the ALL cipher suites
           are reasonably ordered by default

       COMPLEMENTOFALL
           the cipher suites not enabled by ALL, currently being eNULL.

       HIGH
           "high" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with key lengths larger than 128 bits, and some
           cipher suites with 128-bit keys.

       MEDIUM
           "medium" encryption cipher suites, currently some of those using 128 bit encryption.

       LOW Low strength encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit encryption algorithms but excluding
           export cipher suites.  As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are disabled in default builds.

       EXP, EXPORT
           Export strength encryption algorithms. Including 40 and 56 bits algorithms.  As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are
           disabled in default builds.

       EXPORT40
           40-bit export encryption algorithms As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are disabled in default builds.

       EXPORT56
           56-bit export encryption algorithms. In OpenSSL 0.9.8c and later the set of 56 bit export ciphers is empty unless
           OpenSSL has been explicitly configured with support for experimental ciphers.  As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are
           disabled in default builds.

       eNULL, NULL
           The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because these offer no encryption at all and are a
           security risk they are not enabled via either the DEFAULT or ALL cipher strings.  Be careful when building
           cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as kRSA or aECDSA as these do overlap with the eNULL ciphers.
           When in doubt, include !eNULL in your cipherlist.

       aNULL
           The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the anonymous DH algorithms and anonymous ECDH
           algorithms. These cipher suites are vulnerable to a "man in the middle" attack and so their use is normally
           discouraged.  These are excluded from the DEFAULT ciphers, but included in the ALL ciphers.  Be careful when
           building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as kDHE or AES as these do overlap with the aNULL
           ciphers.  When in doubt, include !aNULL in your cipherlist.

       kRSA, RSA
           cipher suites using RSA key exchange.

       kDHr, kDHd, kDH
           cipher suites using DH key agreement and DH certificates signed by CAs with RSA and DSS keys or either
           respectively. Not implemented.

NOTES
       The non-ephemeral DH modes are currently unimplemented in OpenSSL because there is no support for DH certificates.

       Some compiled versions of OpenSSL may not include all the ciphers listed here because some ciphers were excluded at
       compile time.

EXAMPLES
       Verbose listing of all OpenSSL ciphers including NULL ciphers:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

       Include all ciphers except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by strength:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!ADH:@STRENGTH'

       Include all ciphers except ones with no encryption (eNULL) or no authentication (aNULL):

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!aNULL'

       Include only 3DES ciphers and then place RSA ciphers last:

        openssl ciphers -v '3DES:+RSA'

       Include all RC4 ciphers but leave out those without authentication:

        openssl ciphers -v 'RC4:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT'

       Include all chiphers with RSA authentication but leave out ciphers without encryption.

        openssl ciphers -v 'RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL'

HISTORY
       The COMPLENTOFALL and COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT selection options for cipherlist strings were added in OpenSSL 0.9.7.  The
       -V option for the ciphers command was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.
