<p> 
It can be difficult to plot functions like sin(1/x) that vary infinitely
quickly as x approaches a particular value, in this case x = 0. 
Unless the function is sampled more frequently than it oscillates, you will
produce plotting artifacts, as can be seen in the figure to the right.  In
these cases a better result can be obtained by increasing the sample frequency;
in gnuplot the command is  “set samples 1000”, for example.
