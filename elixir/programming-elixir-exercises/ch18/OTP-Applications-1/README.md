# Exercise: OTP-Applications-1
Turn your stack server into an OTP application.

## Solution
It already is! :)

See the most recent [stack](../../ch17/OTP-Supervisors-2/stack/) implementation. More specifically, in the [mix.exs](../../ch17/OTP-Supervisors-2/stack/mix.exs) file, see the *application* function:
```
def application do
  [applications: [:logger],
   mod: {Stack, []}]
end
```

This was automatically generated by mix when we created the project.
