# Python code for RabbitMQ tutorials


Here you can find Python code examples from [RabbitMQ tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).


## Requirements

These examples use the [`qweeze/rstream`](https://github.com/qweeze/rstream) client library.

Get it first with the necessary dependencies:

     pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Code

Code examples are executed via `python3`:

[Tutorial one: "Hello World!"](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python-stream):

    python3 send.py
    python3 receive.py

[Tutorial two: "Offset tracking"](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python-stream):

    python3 offset_tracking_send.py
    python3 offset_tracking_receive.py
